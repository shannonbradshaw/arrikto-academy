# Our Objective for this Module

Though we believe the data science solution in our working example is reasonable,
for the rest of this module we will not focus on the implementation. Instead, we
will focus on a realistic example of the considerations you will want to make and
the process you will need to follow to transform an existing notebook written in
Python into a Kubeflow pipeline that will run on a Kubernetes cluster.
